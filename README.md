# Predictive Maintenance for Static VAR Compensators (SVCs)

A machine learning-based predictive maintenance system for Static VAR Compensators (SVCs). It leverages sensor data to forecast failures, optimize performance, reduce downtime, and improve grid reliability using advanced ML techniques and real-time simulation.

## Features
- Generates realistic SVC sensor data with time-series patterns.
- Uses an LSTM model for time-series failure prediction.
- Simulates real-time sensor monitoring and prediction.
- Provides detailed visualizations (trends, feature importance, predictions).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
[   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/svc-predictive-maintenance.git
   cd svc-predictive-maintenance](https://github.com/kanjibro/predictive-maintenance_SVC)
